# 👋 Hi, I'm Cunwei Qin

## About Me

I am a student currently learning programming and software development. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and have a strong interest in automation. Currently, I am focusing on learning front-end development, exploring web technologies, and building interactive user interfaces.

Through continuous learning and hands-on projects, I am working on mastering Git and GitHub. This is my first personal profile project, and I believe that with persistent learning and practice, I can become a skilled developer. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving problems, and sharing knowledge with other developers.
